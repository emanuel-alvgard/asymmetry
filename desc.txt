# Side panel with most basic complex types
# When creating an object it's default state is empty
# The user can then create as many properties as needed of the primitive types string, number or ref
# Refs can be to other objects (of any type) or one of it's properties
# Both strings and numbers can interpolate object properties.
# All views have 2 contextual searchbars which can search by "key" or "value"
# When creating a ref property either "existing" or "new" can be chosen
# If "new" is chosen the new object can either be blank or use another object as a template.

# The structure can be viewd in different modes like "list" (default), graph or kanban.
