# Side panel with most basic complex types
# When creating an object it's default state is empty
# The user can then create as many properties as needed of the primitive types string, number, object or reference
# References can be to other objects (of any type) or one of it's properties
# Both strings and numbers can interpolate object properties.
# All views have 2 contextual searchbars which can search by "key" or "value"
# When creating an object property the new object can either be blank or use another object as a template.
# all properties and objects can be moved anywhere

# The structure can be viewed in different modes like "object" (default), JSON, graph or kanban.
